# Personal Website

## Overview
This is a personal website and blog built using Jekyll and Bulma CSS, hosted on GitHub Pages.  Rather than using one of the themes provided by GitHub Pages, I wanted to build my own site styling.  I have merged in the layout previously used in my old [web site](https://github.com/zjcz/website).

Jekyll is a static site generator that allows you to build a website using templates and markdown files.  Blog posts can be created by adding a new markdown file and Jekyll will convert this into a full static HTML site.

## Local Development
After cloning the repository, you can run the following commands to start a local server and view the site in your browser.

``` bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
