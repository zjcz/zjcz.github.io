This week I've continued developing my Flutter app, with one big distraction.

## Web Hosting Changes

I manage the website for a charity I volunteer for. We were very lucky to have free hosting provided by Tsohost, who have always been very helpful to us. Unfortunately last year their parent company decided to close them down and migrate all their customers over to 123-Reg. At the time I was under the impression that there would be no changes to the hosting, but on Monday I received an invoice for the yearly hosting charges.

Following an internet search and reading online reviews I decided to move the hosting to [Krystal](https://www.krystal.io/). Once the account was setup Krystal managed the migration for us and I have been really impressed with their service so far.

## What Else?

Nothing much else to report this week. I have been working on my Flutter app and have made some good progress. I am hoping to have a beta version ready in the next few weeks.
